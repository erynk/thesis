One common issue in using accessibility evaluation tools in practice is that the results provided by different tools are often variable. Such variability may confuse the users who may not understand the reasons behind it, and thus limits the possible adoption of such tools. Hence, there is a need to shed light on the tools' actual functioning, indicate what criteria they should adopt to be transparent and to help users better interpret their results. In this communication paper, we discuss such issues, analyse how they have been addressed by a representative set of tools, and provide useful indications for obtaining user-centred accessibility evaluations.},

The recent focus on cognitive accessibility in W3C/{WAI} changes the situation. This chapter discusses the state of the art and the different domains, where R\&D is needed for guidelines and standards, inclusion and participation of end users, take-up of the digital potential in service provision and new tool development based on user tracking/understanding and Artificial Intelligence ({AI}). We conclude by proposing a new concept of user involvement and a framework for R\&D supporting the integration of profiling, annotating, adapting and translating content for personalized Cognitive Accessibility and using/adapting proven and stable {HCI} concepts.},

	abstract = {Web accessibility means that people with some type of disability can make use of the Web in the same conditions as the rest of the people. When we talk about web accessibility, we refer to a web design and development that allows these people to perceive, understand, navigate and interact with the Web. Web accessibility also benefits other people, including elderly people whose abilities have declined as a result of age. The Web is an essential resource in human activity: education, employment, government, commerce, health, entertainment and many others benefit of the power of the Web. The aim of this systematic literature review is to analyze the empirical methods of evaluating accessibility to educational websites, disabilities and their errors described in a total of 25 selected studies. The results show that in 20 of the 25 papers, web accessibility was evaluated with automatic tools, in 2 papers it was evaluated with real users and in the other 3 papers with automatic tools, real users and experts. There is also evidence that all the educational websites analyzed in the papers need to correct errors. In conclusion, educational websites do not meet any version of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines ({WCAG}) and their conformance levels. According to the results, the empirical evaluation methods used for web accessibility could be improved by adopting automatic evaluation tools for website construction and manual mechanisms with web accessibility experts. The challenge for educational institutions is to carry out web accessibility projects to comply with {WCAG} and other web accessibility standards and current laws of educational inclusion.},

Since the manual verification of the fulfilment of guidelines that specify accessibility requirements can often turn out to be difficult and cumbersome, it is crucial to have appropriate computer tools available to assist this activity. There exist numerous applications that perform diverse types of automatic accessibility evaluations. On the other hand, on-site and remote evaluations with users can also be supported by specific tools. Even manual evaluations may be supported by crowdsourcing-based tools. All these innovations may have crucial importance in the advancement of Web accessibility.

There are specific laws that legally mandate postsecondary institutions to have Web sites that are accessible for students with disabilities (e.g., the Americans with Disabilities Act ({ADA})). Web accessibility policies are a way for universities to provide a general guide to action for faculty and staff that serve as Website developers for the organization. The purpose of this study is to examine the extent and effectiveness of Web accessibility policies at land-grant universities in the United States. To that end, this paper presents a conceptual foundation for the study, ranging from an overview of Web accessibility studies, to legal mandates, to literature on organizational policies. Data collection consists of a content analysis of the Web accessibility policies of land-grant universities. Results show that while most universities have a Web accessibility policy, most policies have serious deficiencies. The deficiencies are of sufficient magnitude that many schools are likely in violation of the {ADA} and at risk for a law suit from a disabled person unless these policies are strengthened.},

The project consists of three phases. Phase I sought to identify the critical questions/issues related to disability access that the model needed to address. Phase {II} focused on instrument development, data collection methods, and implementation of a pilot study. Phase {III} was dedicated to dissemination across institutions of higher education in Illinois and finalizing the model. This paper reports the activities and findings of Phase I.

This paper presents the accessibility analysis of higher education websites with the case study of college websites (N=44) affiliated with the University of Kashmir and Cluster University Srinagar. The study has been carried out with two major accessibility evaluation tools called web accessibility test, denoted as {TAW} and the accessibility engine powering browser extensions called the accessibility engine, denoted as {aXe}. This paper lists the major accessibility barriers exposed by these sites in terms of metrics such as a number of problems, warnings and a status of success criteria violations. With respect to {TAW} tool, a number of problems observed were 2646, a large number of warnings to the scale of 15995 and the not reviewed items were 1356. With {aXe} tool, the total violations observed were 1951 and items needing review were 1733. Findings of the statistical analysis are also presented in this paper.
