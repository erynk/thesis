	abstract = {With an increasing demand for computing professionals with skills in accessibility, it is important for university faculty to select effective methods for educating computing students about barriers faced by users with disabilities and approaches to improving accessibility. While some prior work had evaluated accessibility educational interventions, many prior studies have consisted of firsthand reports from faculty or short-term evaluations. This paper reports on the results of a systematic evaluation of methods for teaching accessibility from a longitudinal study across 29 sections of a human-computer interaction course (required for students in a computing degree program), as taught by 10 distinct professors, throughout four years, with over 400 students. A control condition (course without accessibility content) was compared to four intervention conditions: week of lectures on accessibility, team design project requiring some accessibility consideration, interaction with someone with a disability, and collaboration with a team member with a disability. Comparing survey data immediately before and after the course, we found that the Lectures, Projects, and Interaction conditions were effective in increasing students' likelihood to consider people with disabilities on a design scenario, awareness of accessibility barriers, and knowledge of technical approaches for improving accessibility - with students in the Team Member condition having higher scores on the final measure only. However, comparing survey responses from students immediately before the course and from approximately 2 years later, almost no significant gains were observed, suggesting that interventions within a single course are insufficient for producing long-term changes in measures of students’ accessibility learning. This study contributes to empirical knowledge to inform university faculty in selecting effective methods for teaching accessibility, and it motivates further research on how to achieve long-term changes in accessibility knowledge, e.g. by reinforcing accessibility throughout a degree program.},

	abstract = {The {COVID}-19 pandemic has forced institutions to rapidly alter their behavior, which typically has disproportionate negative effects on people with disabilities as accessibility is overlooked. To investigate these issues, we analyzed Twitter data to examine accessibility problems surfaced by the crisis. We identified three key domains at the intersection of accessibility and technology: (i) the allocation of product delivery services, (ii) the transition to remote education, and (iii) the dissemination of public health information. We found that essential retailers expanded their high-risk customer shopping hours and pick-up and delivery services, but individuals with disabilities still lacked necessary access to goods and services. Long-experienced access barriers to online education were exacerbated by the abrupt transition of in-person to remote instruction. Finally, public health messaging has been inconsistent and inaccessible, which is unacceptable during a rapidly-evolving crisis. We argue that organizations should create flexible, accessible technology and policies in calm times to be adaptable in times of crisis to serve individuals with diverse needs.},

	abstract = {Websites figure predominantly in everyday life. However, many websites remain inaccessible to autistic people, and existing efforts to improve accessibility are in early stages, do not directly include autistic users in their development, or have not been empirically evaluated. The Academic Autism Spectrum Partnership in Research and Education ({AASPIRE}) used a community-based participatory research approach to create a website to improve health care access for autistic adults. We used the creation of that website as a “living laboratory” to develop the {AASPIRE} Web Accessibility Guidelines for Autistic Web Users. Our guidelines are grounded in accessibility theory, had autistic end-user involvement at all stages, and were empirically evaluated through a usability study and evaluation surveys. We incorporated what we learned into the design of the website, and compiled the accessibility information into a set of guidelines. The guidelines offer recommendations for increasing the physical, intellectual, and social acceptability of websites for use by autistic adults. In the evaluation of the website by 170 autistic end users, nearly all indicated it was easy to use (97\%), easy to understand (95\%), important (97\%), and useful (96\%). Ninety-two percent would recommend it to a friend, and 95\% would recommend it to a health care provider. There were no significant associations between usability or understandability and education level, receipt of help using the site, browser type (e.g., {IE} or Safari), or device type (e.g., {PC} or tablet). We recommend using the guidelines to improve website accessibility for autistic Internet users.Lay {SummaryAASPIRE} Web Accessibility Guideline: This guideline is a summary of the accessibility features we identified and implemented during the course of our study. None of these items were difficult or expensive for us to implement. They did not require special expertise beyond basic web programming and technical communications skills. We recommend that anyone seeking to create accessible websites for autistic users follow the Academic Autism Spectrum Partnership in Research and Education ({AASPIRE}) Web Accessibility Guideline in addition to broader web and communications standards and principles.Physical accessibility:Provide at least one low-contrast neutral color palette option to accommodate sensitive vision.Provide a selection of color palettes, including one with a dark background and one with a light background, again to accommodate color and contrast sensitivity.Provide a no-style option (i.e., no cascading style sheets ({CSS}) to accommodate browser customization and users who prefer no stylistic formatting.Provide simple consistent navigation and highly consistent site behavior for increased ease of operation.Avoid textured backgrounds, moving images, decorative elements that do not convey information, and other visual and/or sonic “clutter”; these types of elements may make the site difficult or impossible to comprehend.Provide smaller font sizes in addition to larger ones; large font sizes may make the page appear cluttered and difficult to read.Use a plain accessible sans-serif font (e.g., Arial) for ease of readability.Intellectual accessibility:Use the simplest interface possible for ease of understanding.Use simple concrete icons or images to communicate redundant information with text, and accommodate multiple ways of understanding information.Clearly label site elements with their purpose everywhere on the site, even if it seems redundant, to make navigation and site functionality easier to follow.Provide concrete examples where applicable to accommodate difficulties in understanding abstractions or generalizations.Minimize scrolling so the user does not need to rely on assumptions about content to guess what might be on the page.Show all important features and site navigation (as opposed to within combo box drop-down areas) so the user does not need to rely on assumptions to guess whether the item exists and how to access it. For example, completely visible list boxes or radio buttons can be used instead of combo boxes.Make content as short as possible without sacrificing precision and specificity, to reduce cognitive burden.Social accessibility:Be specific and precise in language use; avoid colloquialisms, idioms, and ambiguity to accommodate difficulties with language pragmatics.Explain the reason behind any nonstandard instructions or unusual information; provide additional pragmatic context to accommodate difficulties with language pragmatics.Provide alternatives to definitive response items on surveys and forms, for example, “do not know,” “do not wish to say,” or “not applicable,” to reduce frustration for not being able to produce an exact answer.Use {FAQ} formats to organize complex information to enhance clarity as to why the information might be useful to the user and how it connects to their life.Define terms that might have different meanings depending on social context, or which might be jargon related to a specialized field (e.g., “drug interactions” and “health care providers”), to accommodate difficulties with language pragmatics.Be mindful of autistic culture and community preferences, including the language used to describe autism and how community-based symbols and history might influence content and perception of site credibility.},

	abstract = {The identity and institutional image of universities are presented to the world through their websites. On their websites, universities publish their academic offerings, their mission, their vision, their academic objectives, their achievements, their regulations, their news and all their university work. Hence, the importance of university websites is accessible. The accessibility of university websites has been evaluated several times in the past, but there is no work that has summarized all the evaluations performed to provide a general overview of the situation. Therefore, in this research we have performed a systematic literature review ({SLR}) to consolidate, analyze, synthesize and interpret the accessibility results of university websites published in 42 papers that have been selected for this study. The methodology used in this {SLR} was that proposed in Kitchenham’s guidelines, which includes three stages: planning the review, conducting the review and reporting the review. The results present the analysis and synthesis of the evaluations of 9,140 universities in 67 countries. Of these, 38,416 web pages, 91,421 {YouTube} videos and 28,395 {PDF} documents were evaluated. Manual methods, methods with automatic tools and the combination of both methods were used for the evaluation. Most websites were evaluated using the {ISO}/{IEC} 40500:2012 and Section 508 standards. The accessibility guidelines most commonly violated in the evaluations were: adaptable, compatible, distinguishable, input assistance, keyboard accessible, navigable, predictable, readable and text alternatives. In conclusion, the university websites, {YouTube} videos and {PDF} documents analyzed in the 42 papers present important accessibility problems. The main contribution of this {SLR} is the consolidation of the results of the 42 studies selected to determine the findings and trends in the accessibility of university websites around the world.},

	url = {http://itd.athenpro.org/volume13/number1/thompson.html},
	abstract = {In the current study, researchers conducted a comprehensive semi-automated web search for web or {IT} accessibility policies in all higher education institutions in the United States. At the same time, automated data was collected to measure the accessibility of institutional websites and frequency of results found when searching for "web accessibility" or "technology accessibility" on the websites of each institution (a measure we refer to as "conversation"). It was found that website accessibility varied considerably across the different measures used in the study. The measures with the highest accessibility were headings and alternate text on images. Other accessibility features (labels on form fields, language identified, and tagged {PDF}) were much less likely to be present, with {ARIA} landmark roles the least likely to be present. Overall, Doctorate-granting Universities had the highest web accessibility ratings of all Carnegie classifications; however their ratings were lowest for {PDF} accessibility. Nearly one-tenth (8.4\%) of the institutions had web or technology accessibility policies. The web pages of these institutions had higher overall accessibility ratings, and were especially higher on alt text with images and labeled input fields. However, institutions with a policy were less likely to have tagged {PDFs}. These effects were significant but small due to the large amount of variance within groups. Institutions with a policy also had significantly more "conversation," most dramatically when institutions did not have an accessibility link on their site template. Together, amount of conversation and having a policy accounted for more variance than either factor alone, though the total variance accounted for was very small. Post-hoc analysis showed that institutions with formal, stand alone policies had significantly higher accessibility ratings than institutions with other types of policies. An exploratory stepwise multiple regression analysis revealed that having an accessibility policy in place, being a master’s or doctoral-granting institution, and being in the state of California account for about 3\% of the variance in overall accessibility. Though statistically significant, the remaining 97\% of the variance that is not accounted for indicates that the best predictors of overall accessibility are not available to the model. Further research is warranted in order to identify other factors that may contribute to institutions’ success at implementing accessible websites.},

	abstract = {Section 508 of the Americans with Disabilities Act ({ADA}) mandates that programs and services be accessible to people with disabilities. While schools of library and information science ({SLIS}∗) and university libraries should model accessible Web sites, this may not be the case. This article examines previous studies about the Web accessibility of {SLIS} Web sites and university library Web sites supporting {SLIS} and builds on these studies by providing current data about {SLIS} opportunities for learning about accessible products and services for individuals with disabilities. This study looks at the nation's 12 highest-ranked {SLIS} and at their disability-related curricula. A {WebXACT}-compliance check is used to determine World Wide Web (W3C) compliance for {SLIS} and the main libraries. A survey is distributed to the {SLIS} to determine disability curricular offerings. A Web search of {SLIS} course descriptions for these schools provides clarification about course offerings. The compliance check gives cause for concern. The survey results indicate that most {SLIS} programs offer disability instruction: Specifically most {SLIS} programs offer instruction of Web accessibility. The mixed results from the survey and the compliance check might indicate that the individuals that are responsible for Web design on these campuses are not knowledgeable about W3C standards. The fact that {SLIS} students are being taught appropriate accessibility standards should indicate that the future of Web accessibility is brighter. (∗{SLIS} is used as a generic term throughout the article to refer to all library science, library and information science, information science, and other similar programs.)},

The purpose of this article is to identify trends in web accessibility and long-term impact of outreach and education. Method. Home pages from 127 higher education institutions in the Northwest were evaluated for accessibility three times over a 6-month period in 2004–2005 (Phase I), and again in 2009 (Phase {II}). Schools in the study were offered varying degrees of training and/or support on web accessibility during Phase I. Pages were evaluated for accessibility using a set of manual checkpoints developed by the researchers.Results. Over the 5-year period reported in this article, significant positive gains in accessibility were revealed on some measures, but accessibility declined on other measures. The areas of improvement are arguably the more basic, easy-to-implement accessibility features, while the area of decline is keyboard accessibility, which is likely associated with the emergence of dynamic new technologies on web pages. Even on those measures where accessibility is improving, it is still strikingly low. In Phase I of the study, institutions that received extensive training and support were more likely than other institutions to show improved accessibility on the measures where institutions improved overall, but were equally or more likely than others to show a decline on measures where institutions showed an overall decline. In Phase {II}, there was no significant difference between institutions who had received support earlier in the study, and those who had not.Conclusions. Results suggest that growing numbers of higher education institutions in the Northwest are motivated to add basic accessibility features to their home pages, and that outreach and education may have a positive effect on these measures. However, the results also reveal negative trends in accessibility, and outreach and education may not be strong enough to counter the factors that motivate institutions to deploy inaccessible emerging technologies. Further research is warranted toward identifying the motivational factors that are associated with increased and decreased web accessibility, and much additional work is needed to ensure that higher education web pages are accessible to individuals with disabilities.},

What makes this even more essential is the Chilean legislation which under Law 20422 establishes the regulations regarding equality of opportunity and social inclusion of people with disabilities.

Results from the study indicated an uneven level of readiness by faculty regarding online learning accessibility. Results from the study showed that professional development training in online learning had a very significant influence on accessibility knowledge and practice. Also, high perceptions of knowledge for institutional policy and terminology and low perception of accessibility laws and standards were found. It is also found that training on disability-related laws and regulations provided by higher education institutions was insufficient and at times, does not align with the faculty's schedule.

The Web is an essential resource in human activity: education, employment, government, commerce, health, entertainment and many others benefit of the power of the Web. The aim of this systematic literature review is to analyze the empirical methods of evaluating accessibility to educational websites, disabilities and their errors described in a total of 25 selected studies. The results show that in 20 of the 25 papers, web accessibility was evaluated with automatic tools, in 2 papers it was evaluated with real users and in the other 3 papers with automatic tools, real users and experts. There is also evidence that all the educational websites analyzed in the papers need to correct errors. In conclusion, educational websites do not meet any version of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines ({WCAG}) and their conformance levels. According to the results, the empirical evaluation methods used for web accessibility could be improved by adopting automatic evaluation tools for website construction and manual mechanisms with web accessibility experts. The challenge for educational institutions is to carry out web accessibility projects to comply with {WCAG} and other web accessibility standards and current laws of educational inclusion.},

	abstract = {The Web has become an integral part of postsecondary education within the United States. There are specific laws that legally mandate postsecondary institutions to have Web sites that are accessible for students with disabilities (e.g., the Americans with Disabilities Act ({ADA})). Web accessibility policies are a way for universities to provide a general guide to action for faculty and staff that serve as Website developers for the organization. The purpose of this study is to examine the extent and effectiveness of Web accessibility policies at land-grant universities in the United States. To that end, this paper presents a conceptual foundation for the study, ranging from an overview of Web accessibility studies, to legal mandates, to literature on organizational policies. Data collection consists of a content analysis of the Web accessibility policies of land-grant universities. Results show that while most universities have a Web accessibility policy, most policies have serious deficiencies. The deficiencies are of sufficient magnitude that many schools are likely in violation of the {ADA} and at risk for a law suit from a disabled person unless these policies are strengthened.},

This qualitative research design utilized a listserv that invited university based webmasters to use freeware to evaluate the overall accessibility of their institutions' homepage website. Participation was voluntary and evaluations were gathered electronically. Our sample indicated that most universities' homepages were non-compliant with the www.{WorldWideWeb} Consortium guidelines. One particular institution, however, satisfied all W3C guidelines earning a perfect Triple A. Simply stated, this exemplary website serves people of all exceptionalities. Studying this institution's implementation process, we propose that other institutions might emulate this exemplary model to achieve greater website accessibility for all constituents.},

	abstract = {The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) has provided the most important set of guidelines for web accessibility which is popularly known as Web Content Accessibility Guidelines ({WCAG}). The accessibility analysis of higher education websites becomes paramount important to make them inclusive considering the growing number of enrollments of persons with disabilities ({PwDs}) in higher education, in countries such as India. This paper presents the accessibility analysis of higher education websites with the case study of college websites (N=44) affiliated with the University of Kashmir and Cluster University Srinagar. The study has been carried out with two major accessibility evaluation tools called web accessibility test, denoted as {TAW} and the accessibility engine powering browser extensions called the accessibility engine, denoted as {aXe}. This paper lists the major accessibility barriers exposed by these sites in terms of metrics such as a number of problems, warnings and a status of success criteria violations. With respect to {TAW} tool, a number of problems observed were 2646, a large number of warnings to the scale of 15995 and the not reviewed items were 1356. With {aXe} tool, the total violations observed were 1951 and items needing review were 1733. Findings of the statistical analysis are also presented in this paper. This paper presents a roadmap of steps for making these websites inclusive and barrier-free for {PwDs}.},
