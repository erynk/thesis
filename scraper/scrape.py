# to search

'''
Required Function and its parameters 

query: query string that we want to search for.
TLD: TLD stands for the top-level domain which means we want to search our results on google.com or google. in or some other domain.
lang: lang stands for language.
num: Number of results we want.
start: The first result to retrieve.
stop: The last result to retrieve. Use None to keep searching forever.
pause: Lapse to wait between HTTP requests. Lapse too short may cause Google to block your IP. Keeping significant lapses will make your program slow but itâ€™s a safe and better option.
Return: Generator (iterator) that yields found URLs. If the stop parameter is None the iterator will loop forever.
